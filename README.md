node/python playground
======================

this is just a little git repo that i put together to play around with C++, python, and node.

for now i'm just playing with the goal of maybe being able to call a Python function from within
node.js. I'm not sure why that excites me. I'm sure it's along the same reasons as why I like
Lord of the Rings so much, or why I think Grand Admiral Thrawn was an amazing tactician.

*ImeanIlovegoingoutsideandplayingbasketballUHHHHH*.

anyway. this is in no way "good" code. it's going to reflect me catching up with 4 years of 
inactivity in C++, as well as getting a grasp of the V8 and Python C/C++ bindings. And yeah,
the last C++ compiler I used was MSVC .NET 2003. So I'm a bit rusty.

Anyway, in *theory* all you need to do is run:

    brew install node
    node-waf configure build
    node test.js
